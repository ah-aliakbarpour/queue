# Queue

The queue type represents a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue of generic items implemented using a linked list.
It supports the usual Enqueue and Dequeue operations, along with methods for peeking at the first item, getting the size of the queue and testing if the queue is empty.
The Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek, Size, and IsEmpty operations all take constant time in the worst case.
